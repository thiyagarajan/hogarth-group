      Training</h2>\r\n<p>On first joining the Club, members receive 5 complimentary
      one on one personal training sessions lasting one hour each. This time allows
      our team to really understand what you want to achieve, what's safe and realistic,
      as well as getting to really know you and how best to keep you motivated and
      on track. To maintain and develop our relationship with you and your goals,
      every member also receives one complimentary Personal Training session every
      month of their membership thereafter. For most this approach really works.</p>\r\n<h2>The
      Trainers</h2>\r\n<p>Full details of the club's Personal Trainers are available
      on the Personal Training notice board or via this <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/the-hogarth-group-websites/attachments/469/original.pdf?1331911935\">PT

      commitment to maintain the highest standards of staff attention and detail,
      some members may feel they require more frequent support and encouragement.
      For these members we are able to offer Personal Training Xtra. <strong>Personal
      Training Xtra is the ultimate gymnasium experience.</strong> Our clubs are therefore
      able to offer Personal Training Xtra in accordance with the terms and conditions
      below.</p>\r\n<h2>Do I need Personal Training Xtra?</h2>\r\n<p>Firstly, all
      members are encouraged to benefit from the Personal Training services that are
      inclusive of their membership. The majority of members will consider the inclusive
      Personal Training service provided to be sufficient for their needs. However,
      you may feel you need more in the way of motivation or guidance to help you
      achieve your goals or to train for something specific. If this is the case Personal
      Training Xtra may offer what you are looking for.</p>\r\n<h2>What are the benefits
      of Personal Training Xtra?</h2>\r\n<p>More regular Personal Training sessions
      can offer a guaranteed, personal, uninterrupted schedule of appointments at
      a time convenient to you and should provide you with the following benefits:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Improved
      motivation</li>\r\n<li>Enhanced continuity</li>\r\n<li>Constant encouragement</li>\r\n<li>Greater
      direction</li>\r\n<li>Continual guidance</li>\r\n<li>Swifter progression</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Availability</h2>\r\n<p>Personal
      Training Xtra is available to any club member whose membership entitles them
      to use the gymnasium.</p>\r\n<h2>How often should I have Personal Training Xtra
      sessions?</h2>\r\n<p>This is entirely up to you and is dependent on your needs
      and goals. You may feel that once a week or fortnight is sufficient to supplement
      your inclusive sessions. If you feel that the one - to - one nature of Personal
      Training is the only way to adhere to regular exercise, then this will be the
      determining factor.</p>\r\n<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>\r\n<p>Personal Training
      Xtra session rates are available in single and discounted block bookings. Please
      consult the Personal Training Xtra notice board or a member of the personal
      training team for details. Payment for all appointments must be in advance and
      directly to the Personal Trainer. Cash and cheques are accepted but we regret
      we are unable to accept credit/debit cards.</p>\r\n<p>24 hours notice must be
      provided if you wish to cancel an appointment. Failure to do so will result
      in the full fee being charged.</p>\r\n<div class=\"call_to_action\">\r\n<h3>Call

- Metabolic Profiling:
    _slug: metabolic-profiling
    image: /samples/content/metabolic-profiling/main-content-image.jpg
    body: "<p>Metabolic profile testing is the 'gold standard' when it comes to accurately
      determining what your body's energy requirements are and how you respond to
      exercise. Current technology allows us to accurately determine this rather than
      estimating it.</p>\r\n<p>Hogarth membership includes regular consultations with
      your Personal Trainer, however to optimise your exercise time for the ultimate
      benefits you may wish to consider Metabolic Profile Testing. Our commitment
      to acquiring innovative and cutting edge equipment accompanied by the most skilled
      Personal Trainers in the industry gives you an opportunity to achieve your exercise
      and lifestyle results like never before.</p>\r\n<h2>What is Metabolic Profile
      Testing?</h2>\r\n<p>A simple assessment allows your metabolic profile to be
      'captured' and the information will produce your individual metabolic profile.
      The profile includes your resting metabolic rate (RMR), your daily calorific
      needs and the heart rate zones in which your body best responds to exercise.
      Testing is quick and easy and includes a test to determine your resting metabolic
      rate and another test to determine your metabolic responses to exercise. Throughout
      the test the system is capturing information about your heart rate, oxygen uptake
      and carbon dioxide output.</p>\r\n<h2>How Does Metabolic Profiling Help?</h2>\r\n<p>With
      your unique profile you can more easily achieve weight loss goals and improve
      aerobic fitness by optimising your exercise plan. Your resting test illustrates
      how many calories you can eat without gaining weight and how you can maximise
      calories burned in every workout. Your exercise test results show what heart
      rate zones to train in for your body to become more efficient at burning fat
      as an energy source, how to build a stronger &amp; wider aerobic base and what
      your anaerobic threshold is and how to move this higher. Whatever your training
      goals are, your metabolic profile is the key to training more effectively and
      efficiently to optimise your training results.</p>\r\n<h2>Preparing for your
      Test</h2>\r\n<p>For more information about Metabolic Profile Testing or to make
      an appointment please speak to a Personal Trainer. Metabolic Profile Tests cost
      &pound;125 per test. To ensure that your results are accurate and consistent
      it is necessary to prepare in advance. Please:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Abstain from
      food including tea and coffee for 8 hours prior to your test. Drinking water
      is fine.</li>\r\n<li>Abstain from alcohol for 12 hours prior to your test.</li>\r\n<li>Avoid
      doing a high intensity training session the previous day.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div

      Pilates Method was originally developed by Joseph Pilates in the 1920's. Joseph
      Pilates practiced and taught his method (originally called Contrology) throughout
      his life up to his death at the age of 86.</p>\r\n<p>Pilates is a conditioning
      exercise programme that targets the deep postural muscles of the abdomen and
      spine to improve overall central core stability and posture. The following eight
      Pilates principles are: Concentration, centering, breathing, isolation, routine,
      precision, control and flowing movement.</p>\r\n<p>Clinical Pilates is a series
      of exercises in various different body positions which have been adapted by
      physiotherapists to make them more suitable for patients with back and neck
      pain, and those recovering from injury. They are also useful for general conditioning
      and for prevention of injury through muscle wastage and poor posture.</p>\r\n<p>By
      completing Pilates exercises regularly, it can help to improve your posture,
      strength and flexibility alongside a healthy lifestyle.</p>\r\n<p>Many patients
      find that Pilates is a useful form of exercise when returning to their normal
      hobbies/sports following injury and as an addition to their fitness regime.
      Who would have thought that many rugby teams around the world would use Pilates
      as a valuable addition to their game winning strategies?</p>\r\n<p>Evidence
      supports the use of the Pilates method in the prevention and rehabilitation
      of back injuries. By retraining the deep abdominal and spinal muscles, Pilates
      can help to prevent the recurrence of back pain in combination with correct
      back care and advice, and gentle aerobic activity.</p>\r\n<p>For these reasons
      we truly believe that this branch of The Pilates Method is the most valuable
      and is a greatest addition to any existing fitness routine or to pull anyone
      out of a sedentary lifestyle.</p>\r\n<div class=\"call_to_action\">\r\n<h3>Call

    body: "<p>We have two regular weekly tennis coaches at The Hogarth, Jose and Berj.</p>\r\n<h2>Jose
      Marquez</h2>\r\n<p>I have been involved in the tennis coaching industry for
      12 years, having gained immeasurable amounts of experience in all fields and
      types of coaching. I am a firm believer in my tennis coaching philosophy which
      is commitment, determination, perseverance and of course enjoyment.</p>\r\n<p>I
      hope my players feel they are learning these different qualities through the
      help of my coaching whether it be in a one to one or group situation.</p>\r\n<p>My
      own tennis journey started years ago at a club called Rocks lane. It was here
      where through the coaching methods used the foundations were laid for me to
      learn discipline and respect, not just for myself and for my fellow squad players
      and my coaches but for the game that we call tennis.</p>\r\n<p>I left Rocks
      Lane at the age of 18 to attend the Gerry Dippenar Tennis Academy in South Africa.
      I left this academy having played to a high level ready to embark on my first
      serious coaching job.</p>\r\n<p>For the next ten years, I would spend my time
      honing my skills as a tennis coach at the Riverside Club in Chiswick where every
      opportunity was presented to me to work with adult tennis players and junior
      tennis players of different abilities. During the holidays I would also look
      after the Tiny Tots Camps and the Multi Sports programme available for the junior
      players. It was towards the end of my coaching at the Riverside that I helped
      put in place, alongside Simon Ainley, Head of Performance tennis at the club,
      the mini tennis red performance academy.</p>\r\n<p>Whilst coaching at the Hogarth,
      I think the defining quality that I can bring to the club is always being mindful
      of my responsibility as a coach whilst realising that fun is a key element of
      coaching. Consequently I am able to work with both adults and juniors with equal
      success and enthusiasm which can be rare in an individual.</p>\r\n<p>My future
      coaching aspirations will be to strive to extend my skills by updating and improving
      my LTA coaching qualification by attending coach education courses and keeping
      abreast of current trends and thinking. This I know will keep me &lsquo;fresh&rsquo;
      and &lsquo;enthused&rsquo; about tennis and my involvement in the coaching side
      of it.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>QUALIFICATIONS:</li>\r\n<li>USPTR TENNIS PROFESSIONAL

    body: "<p>Chiropractic procedure is directed at evaluating causative factors in
      the biomechanical and structural derangements of the spine, which can affect
      the nervous system and the body's natural defence mechanism. It seeks to restore
      the spinal structural integrity, which has an effect on the total health of
      the individual. Doctors of Chiropractic do not elect to utilise drugs or surgery
      in their practice; however, there are times when they recommend that a patient
      consult another practitioner if other methods of treatments are indicated.</p>\r\n<p>The
      first visit will involve a full case history, a thorough orthopaedic, neurological
      and chiropractic examination to identify the cause of the condition. By analysis
      of the orientation of the spine joints, muscles and ligaments, problems can
      be diagnosed and appropriate corrective treatments given for many conditions,
      including lumbago, \"slipped discs\", herniated discs, sciatica, neck, shoulder
      and arm pain, headaches and migraine, dizziness, \"pins and needles\" numbness,
      period pain, arthritis, hip and knee problems and muscular aches and joint pains.
      Asthma and bed-wetting can also be treated on young adults and children.</p>\r\n<h2>Laurie
      Launay: Chiropractor</h2>\r\n<p>I qualified as a Chiropractor from the chiropractic
      University in Atlanta (USA) in March 1993. After gaining experience working
      in a private practice in Atlanta over a 6 year period I came over to England
      and settled in London in 1999.</p>\r\n<p>I am registered with the General Chiropractic
      Council and the Scottish Chiropractic Association. Since graduating I have expanded
      my skill sets and experience with post-graduate studies in various techniques
      such as Cranial Therapy Treatment during pregnancy and I am certified in Chiropractic
      Paediatric by the I.C.P.A (International Chiropractic Paediatric Association).
      Over the past 15 years I have gained extensive experience in treating a large
      cross section of the community including, infants, children, the elderly and
      pregnant women.</p>\r\n<p>I am extremely passionate about chiropractic treatment
      and I find it very gratifying to see a patient&rsquo;s health improve through
      a non-invasive treatment. The ultimate satisfaction is to see patients recognizing
      the benefits to their general well-being that Chiropractic treatment offers.
      With long term treatment and a maintenance program the benefits can be life
      long. I have been following some of my patients for almost a decade since I
      set up in London. I believe that optimum health can be achieved with a well
      balanced life style including a healthy spine and cranium along with good balanced
      nutrition, good hydration and regular exercise.</p>\r\n<div class=\"call_to_action\">\r\n<h3>Call

    body: "<p>We are delighted to welcome two new professionals to The Hogarth Clinic.
      Carlo Constandinou and Katie Hunter run The Chiswick Osteopathic Clinic and
      have been working as osteopaths for many years.</p>\r\n<h2>Carlo Constandinou</h2>\r\n<p>\"I
      have been practicing for over twenty years; during that time I have developed
      a very family orientated practice.</p>\r\n<p>The type of osteopathy I practice
      is very gentle and suitable for all ages, from newborn babies upwards. I enjoy
      the challenge of working with complex problems and have a keen interest in biomechanics
      and the physiology of pain. I very much see my role as treating the present
      problem but also making sure it does not return. I hope that when leaving a
      visit at our practice the client will know a lot more about how to stay pain
      free than when they arrived.</p>\r\n<p>I spent years at the Osteopathic Centre
      for Children as one of the senior osteopaths where I was in charge of a team
      treating babies and children with a variety of conditions.</p>\r\n<p>I had the
      good fortune to meet and work with fantastic paediatric osteopaths. I regularly
      attended the paediatric intensive care unit at Barnet General where I treated
      severely premature babies through a glove box. I also attended Great Ormond
      Street Children&rsquo;s hospital when any of our patients were admitted there.</p>\r\n<p>I
      look forward to meeting and working with some of you from our clinic upstairs
      here at The Hogarth.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h2>Katie Hunter</h2>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I have
      been in practice for over ten years and my approach, like Carlo's, is very gentle
      and integrated. I have a strong background in science with a first class degree
      in microbiology. I was particularly struck by the comment of the founder of
      osteopathy who said that without good circulation good health is not possible.
      With this in mind I have developed particular skill in lymphatic drainage which,
      coupled with my other osteopathic skills, I find is a very effective holistic
      approach to health. The work has helped patients with conditions such as post
      operative swelling and discomfort, MS and bloating.</p>\r\n<p>I use a lot of
      soft tissue techniques in my work and this allows me to treat people who feel

      assesses and treats symptoms resulting from injury, or those which develop from
      poor postural habits that stress joints, ligaments, muscles, soft tissue and
      nerves. An expert knowledge of body mechanics and function is used to identify
      the origin of symptoms. Many therapy skills and techniques are used: manipulative
      therapy; postural advice; mobilisation therapy; electrotherapy; and soft tissue
      techniques. Corrective exercises are used to restore the balance between weak
      muscles and tight structures. Prevention of further symptoms is achieved with
      the prescription of exercises, advice and suggested changes to training programmes
      and office ergonomics. Each programme is tailor-made.</p>\r\n<h2>Louise Jewers

    body: "<h3>What is Acupuncture?</h3>\r\n<p>Acupuncture is the time tested therapy
      that has been practiced in the Far East for thousands of years. The philosophy
      behind the treatment is that energy lines or meridians circulate around the
      body. These meridians contain our energy flow or &ldquo;qi&rdquo;. It is when
      this qi is impaired through the body that imbalance and illness occurs. With
      the insertion of fine needles at various points on the meridian, the energy
      can be moved or redirected to where it is needed most. In this way the body's
      balance can be restored and the illness resolved.</p>\r\n<p>The flow of energy
      can be disrupted in many ways; emotional upset, physical trauma, poor diet or
      overwork are all common examples. By examining this underlying cause and how
      it has affected the body, the most appropriate treatment for the patient can
      be selected. Treating the patient as an individual is at the core of the acupuncture
      treatment and it this that helps allow the body to rebalance itself.</p>\r\n<p>Blocked
      energy can manifest itself in areas that are painful or are particularly cold
      or hot, or a different colour. These signs can help determine which points are
      most suitable.</p>\r\n<p>Western medicine has different opinions on how acupuncture
      works but in short, no one is really sure. However trial after trial consistently
      proves it effectiveness.</p>\r\n<p>Acupuncture also includes other techniques
      such as cupping, moxibustion or acupressure.</p>\r\n<h2>The London Acupuncture
      Clinic</h2>\r\n<p>The London Acupuncture Clinic joined The Hogarth Clinic in
      2011 and since then they have built up a loyal and satisfied client base. They
      also have long established clinics in Harley Street, Ealing and Windsor. For
      full clinic details, please visit <a href=\"http://www.londonacupuncture.co.uk\">www.londonacupuncture.co.uk</a></p>\r\n<p>The

      and a member of the British Acupuncture Council. She graduated from the University
      of Westminster with a First Class Honours Degree in Chinese Medicine: Acupuncture

      Pilates Method was originally developed by Joseph Pilates in the 1920's. Joseph
      Pilates practiced and taught his method (originally called Contrology) throughout
      his life up to his death at the age of 86.</p>\r\n<p>Pilates is a conditioning
      exercise programme that targets the deep postural muscles of the abdomen and
      spine to improve overall central core stability and posture. The following eight
      Pilates principles are: Concentration, centering, breathing, isolation, routine,
      precision, control and flowing movement.</p>\r\n<p>Clinical Pilates is a series
      of exercises in various different body positions which have been adapted by
      physiotherapists to make them more suitable for patients with back and neck
      pain, and those recovering from injury. They are also useful for general conditioning
      and for prevention of injury through muscle wastage and poor posture.</p>\r\n<p>By
      completing Pilates exercises regularly, it can help to improve your posture,
      strength and flexibility alongside a healthy lifestyle.</p>\r\n<p>Many patients
      find that Pilates is a useful form of exercise when returning to their normal
      hobbies/sports following injury and as an addition to their fitness regime.
      Who would have thought that many rugby teams around the world would use Pilates
      as a valuable addition to their game winning strategies?</p>\r\n<p>Evidence
      supports the use of the Pilates method in the prevention and rehabilitation
      of back injuries. By retraining the deep abdominal and spinal muscles, Pilates
      can help to prevent the recurrence of back pain in combination with correct
      back care and advice, and gentle aerobic activity.</p>\r\n<p>For these reasons
      we truly believe that this branch of The Pilates Method is the most valuable
      and is a greatest addition to any existing fitness routine or to pull anyone
      out of a sedentary lifestyle.</p>\r\n<div class=\"call_to_action\">\r\n<h3>Call

      on country club lines, with health and sports facilities. The Hogarth Health
      Club, which opened in 1981, was one of the very first of such clubs in Europe
      and carried the first range of Nautilus equipment outside the USA.</p>\r\n<p>As
      the facilities at Hogarth aged, an extensive programme of expansion and refurbishment
      was completed in 1993, which provided entirely new changing facilities and a
      new pool. The Hogarth Clinic was also established in 1993 with a wide range
      of practitioners providing a most successful centre for both conventional and
      complementary medicine.</p>\r\n<p>Further refurbishments followed with major
      development works of improvement in 2007 when a new first floor was added to
      provide a dedicated holistic studio, new Clinic area and Beauty Spa.</p>\r\n<p>Now
      in 2013 we are refurbishing the gymnasium with the very latest, state of the
      art equipment from TechnoGym. This &pound;750,000 refurbishment also incorporates
      new flooring, lighting, decor and layout and we are looking forward to providing
      Hogarth members with not only the finest gymnasium team but the latest and ultimate
      gymnasium equipment available.</p>\r\n<p>Seeking a large site with potential
      for extensive outdoor recreation and sport, the Group acquired the 27-acre Manor
      House Grounds in May 1997. Construction began at the end of 1998 and The Park
      Club opened in January 2000. The Club is a departure from the health &amp; fitness
      model, offering a much broader range of services and providing for the needs
      of the family. The Club's membership was fully subscribed in its first year
      of operation.</p>\r\n<h2>Hogarth Leisure Limited</h2>\r\n<p>Hogarth Leisure
      is the consulting and design arm of the Hogarth Group. It is responsible for
      project work in the leisure field and has severally been involved in architecture,
      staff training, club establishment and management, project consultancy and product
      sales and distribution. HLL has also been long involved in the provision of
      occupational health &amp; fitness facilities to UK companies.</p>\r\n<p>The
      Group's design arm has established a worldwide client and project list that
      includes the design of The Fitness Workshop (SW6), Hendon Squash &amp; Leisure
      Club (NW4), Wellingtons Health Club (SE1) and of course the Group's own Clubs
      in London. Outside the capital the Group have completed successful design projects
      for Howdon Squash and Tennis Club (Beckenham), Gloucester Squash Club, St. Albans

      Leisure Consultants to Whitbread PLC, Coral Leisure PLC, Lonrho PLC, Community
      Leisure PLC, Kentish Homes PLC and Rosehaugh Stanhope Development PLC.</p>\r\n<p>In

      at Blunsdon House Hotel (Swindon), Preston Cross Hotel (Bookham), Moor Hall
      (Sutton Coldfield) and Noke Hotel (St. Albans). They have acted as Leisure Consultants
      to Best Western Group, Thistle Hotels, Anchor Hotels, Metropole Hotels and Taj

    body: "<p>The Hogarth Group is constantly expanding and is always looking to recruit
      ambitious individuals who are willing to share in our vision. Many members of
      The Hogarth Group's team have been with the company for many years and several
      have even disappeared on world travels before being welcomed back to the company
      in due course. There is a great team spirit and employment with us offers many
      benefits that accrue from the Group being a family concern.</p>\r\n<p>Excellent
      salary terms are offered, along with the benefit of using our luxurious facilities.
      In fact, in order to gain a first hand 'member experience', we encourage our
      staff to use the full range of facilities that the Group offers.</p>\r\n<p>Our
      long opening hours mean that there are many part-time and flexible roles to
      fill. These also confer use of facilities and have attractive hourly rates of
      pay.</p>\r\n<p>There may be, at any given time, full-time and part-time vacancies
      for any of the positions listed below:</p>\r\n<h2>Gymnasium Physiologists</h2>\r\n<p>At
      the core of our product is our ability to provide professional guidance, motivation

      aged, disabled and wholly inactive. These skills are essential to maintaining
      a satisfied membership; the Hogarth Group's team are at the forefront of applied
      exercise science. Opportunities exist for further training at every level and
      staff are encouraged to participate in the Hogarth Group's personal training
      programmes to provide extra motivation and reward. The tools available to physiology
      staff are second to none, with the FitLinxx interactive training management
      system assisting staff in maintaining communication with a \"mentor group\"
      of members of regulated size. Staff are also encouraged to look beyond the gymnasium
      to the many opportunities for sport and other activities that are available
      to Group members.</p>\r\n<h2>Receptionists</h2>\r\n<p>Receptionists are charged
      with greeting and brightening the day of all our members and prospective members,
      undertaking tours of the facilities, handling bookings and a wide range of other

      White &ndash; Managing Director</h2>\r\n<p>As many of you may know, I took over
      from my late brother as Managing Director of the Hogarth Group. I would like
      to assure you that it is the avowed intention of my father and I to continue
      Patrick&rsquo;s vision and ensure the successful future of our clubs, as a family
      business, to eventually pass on to our children.</p>\r\n<p>However, some of
      you know me and may be a trifle concerned that the somewhat less than smartly
      dressed builder and cappuccino drinker, prone to disappearing for months on
      end, is now the MD of your club. In an attempt to allay your, frankly justifiable,
      fears I shall tell you something of my life.</p>\r\n<p>Patrick was my younger
      brother and whilst he followed me from Fox Primary to Latymer Upper, he declined
      to follow me into the Parachute Regiment and onto the building site. Instead,
      he gained a scholarship to King&rsquo;s College Cambridge and the ability to
      describe me as having a peripatetic existence. It was not difficult to see who
      had the most brains. While Patrick was swotting, I was playing squash at the
      then Lambton Squash Club, when I wasn&rsquo;t developing my cultural and social
      skills in it&rsquo;s bar. This has left me with a deep affection for the club,
      but a deficiency in qualifications.</p>\r\n<p>The part-time Army became an important
      part of my life for the next twenty odd years and recently George and Tony&rsquo;s
      plan for world domination has had me scurrying around countries that you don&rsquo;t
      often read about in the Travel section of the Sunday Times. I am proud to say
      I have been shot at, thankfully with a deplorable degree of accuracy, in three
      different campaigns. Amongst other things, I have kept some very nasty people
      apart in Bosnia and Afghanistan, and been responsible for training anti-terrorist
      troops in the Middle East. I also found time for a considerable amount of mountaineering
      and was lucky (and foolish) enough to become the first British Serviceman to
      climb to the summit of Everest by the North Ridge, suffering frostbite in somewhat
      embarrassing circumstances. I am more than aware of the supreme irony that I
      have escaped with superficial damage and that Patrick should lose his life.</p>\r\n<p>Despite
      these distractions, I have somehow managed to supervise all our major building
      works since starting as the world&rsquo;s weediest hod-carrier in 1979, giving
      me an in-depth knowledge of all our projects and operations. I believe these
      experiences will stand me in good stead to lead our staff, who are particularly
      tremendous, to provide the best possible health club for your enjoyment.</p>\r\n<hr
      />\r\n<div id=\"giles_stumpe\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Giles Stumpe, General Manager</h2>\r\n<p>Born
      and bred in rural Buckinghamshire I despised London as a child, how things change.
      I obtained a B.Sc (Hons) in Sports Studies and Geology at the great sporting
      college, Borough Road in West London and then joined the Hogarth Group at Lambton
      Place in Nottinghill.</p>\r\n<p>After 4 years I went to rehabilitate a spinal
      patient in Antigua. Eight months of rum and sun got the better of me so I headed
      back to Hogarth and have been here ever since.</p>\r\n<p>I met my fianc&eacute;e
      at Borough Road and we now have 4 children, what an eye opener.</p>\r\n<p>My
      other family is here and I would not want to work for any other company.</p>\r\n<hr
      />\r\n<div id=\"gill_forster\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Gill Forster &ndash; Group
      Membership Manager</h2>\r\n<p>I started in 1993 as Membership Manager and Duty
      Manager at The Hogarth Health Club, in Airedale Avenue Chiswick. My years there
      cemented my love of the Health Club business and my fanatical desire to have
      perfect data. I was in charge of all the new and transferring members to The
      Park Club from 1999 and even though I still oversee The Hogarth Health Club
      membership department my &ldquo;seat&rdquo; is at The Park Club.</p>\r\n<p>Born
      in the UK, I sailed to Southern Africa (landing in Beira, Mozambique then travelling
      overland) with my family when I was 9years old to live in Southern Rhodesia.
      I was fortunate to enjoy many sports in the wonderful climate and have always
      had an obsession with tennis (even though at school, hockey was my most victorious!).
      After a few years of living and working in South Africa I returned to the UK
      when I was 21.</p>\r\n<p>After several years as Assistant Accountant with a
      commercial property agent, I became an Air Stewardess with BOAC (BOAC merged
      with BEA in 1975 to become BA). Pregnancy and my husband starting our own interior
      design business forced me to clip my wings and become co-owner of Interior Selection
      which became a household name. The business dissolved in the late 80&rsquo;s
      and after a brief stint working on the ground at Heathrow, I joined The Hogarth
      Group management team in 1993.</p>\r\n<p>Although I am not 1st team material,
      I absolutely love watching and playing tennis and will always accept an offer
      of a game (doubles only now!) especially in the Dome. I&rsquo;m also to be seen
      in the studio for my very favourite class &ndash; Stretchworks with Alison,
      which is absolutely brilliant &amp; beneficial irrelevant of age or ability!</p>\r\n<hr
      />\r\n<div id=\"jo_huff\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Jo Huff, Beauty Spa Manager</h2>\r\n<p>I
      first started working the The Hogarth Health in 1998. I had wanted to be a beauty
      therapist from as far back as I can remember and I was lucky enough to learn
      my skills at the London College of Fashion.</p>\r\n<p>I completed my HND beauty
      therapy qualification in 1998. I then went on to work on a cruise ship before
      starting at the Hogarth.</p>\r\n<p>I took over managing the Hogarth Beauty Spa
      in 2006. I have enjoyed watching the Beauty Spa develop and grow over the years
      I have worked here.</p>\r\n<p>The part of my job I enjoy the most is helping
      clients unwind and relax and making a real difference to their day. My ultimate
      goal is to deliver 100% client satisfaction.</p>\r\n<p>I know many of our lovely
      members already and urge any of you that don't currently use the Beauty area
      to do so. My team and I are a friendly bunch, very happy to give advice and
      always providing a top quality service.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<div id=\"terry_rodham\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Terry
      Rodham &ndash; Group Gymnasium Manager</h2>\r\n<p>I first walked through the
      front doors of the Hogarth way back in 1989 after returning from College in
      Chicago &ndash; oh how things have changed!</p>\r\n<p>I started as a part time
      instructor and am now the Groups Health and Fitness Manager and I absolutely
      love what I do. I work with a fantastic team of people every day and count myself
      very lucky.</p>\r\n<p>My passion in life is helping others and I really enjoy
      helping people to achieve their goals, however big or small they may be. My
      role is to help and guide people along that path.</p>\r\n<p>Hard work = Rewards
      and success!</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<div id=\"Jo Harris\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Jo Harris,
      Sales &amp; Marketing Manager</h2>\r\n<p>I was born and bred in South Yorkshire
      in a small mining town and came to London at the age of 20 to study Drama and
      pursue a career in the theatre.</p>\r\n<p>I took a little detour and found myself
      here at The Hogarth. I Joined the Hogarth Group in February 2000 and have never
      looked back.</p>\r\n<p>Being a bit of a tom boy I have always enjoyed sports
      and the outdoors. My passions are old cars, cycling, trekking and being in the
      mountains&hellip; and of course my son Casey who makes me laugh every day.</p>\r\n<p>My
      role within the company is to welcome new people into the &ldquo;Hogarth family&rdquo;
      and help them enjoy a healthier happier lifestyle. It is extremely rewarding
      and I couldn&rsquo;t imagine being anywhere else!</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<div id=\"rebecca_robertson\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Rebecca
      Robertson</h2>\r\n<p>I joined the Hogarth team as a full time receptionist in
      autumn 2012 and am now also part of the Duty management team.</p>\r\n<p>I have
      always had a passion for Dance, both competing and performing worldwide for
      various music artists and events since a young age.</p>\r\n<p>This passion extends
      to a love of fitness and wellbeing. Growing up with a mother who is a personal
      trainer and exercise addict activity is all I have ever known!</p>\r\n<p>I'm
      a Zumba instructor and love being able to combine my love of dance and fitness
      together. Being able to work in an environment with like-minded people, who
      strive for excellence, is a bonus. This really comes through at the Hogarth.</p>\r\n<p>I'm
      looking forward to continuing my professional development here at the Hogarth

    body: "<p>Hogarth's abcs cr&egrave;che operates within the new Early Years Foundation
      Stage (EYFS) day-care framework. EYFS is a programme aimed at 0 &ndash; 5 year
      olds. It is compulsory for all childcare settings that offer day-care to meet
      the standards set within this framework. EYFS is based around play and, for
      children, it should be used to create a fun, happy, safe place for them to grow
      and learn. Each child will have a key person, who will do regular observations
      and record their development. This record will then be given to you to take
      to the school or nursery your child moves onto.</p>\r\n<h3>About our cr&egrave;che
      and day-care facility</h3>\r\n<p>ABCs is a multicultural childcare establishment
      in which we are committed to providing the highest quality of childcare. We
      accommodate children from 3 months to 8 years and all activities follow the
      curriculum, which is child-led and age-appropriate.</p>\r\n<p>We suggest all
      new children attend the cr&egrave;che for a minimum of 2 sessions lasting approximately
      &frac12; an hour for settling in. The parent will be required to stay during
      these sessions. This helps the child to adapt in the new surrounding and feel
      comfortable and confident to attend a full hour&rsquo;s session. For your child
      to do their best and reach their full potential we allow as many visits as are
      needed to soothe and settle them.</p>\r\n<p>Consistent attendance in the cr&egrave;che
      will enable your child to develop in the six areas of learning and development
      which are: Personal, Social and Emotional, Communication, Language and Literacy,
      Knowledge and understanding of The World, Creative Development, Physical Development,
      and Problem Solving, Reasoning and Numeracy.</p>\r\n<p>If you have any questions
      about the creche, would like to visit us or book a settling in session, please
      call us on 020 8995 4600.</p>\r\n<h2>Areas of Development - EYFS</h2>\r\n<p>All
      staff are fully trained on the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) and we continue
      to meet yours and your child&rsquo;s needs. The Cr&egrave;che team is available
      to answer any questions about the EYFS. Claire the Cr&egrave;che Manager is
      always happy to help so drop in or give a call if you have any questions.</p>\r\n<p>Participation
      in a cr&egrave;che setting will enable your child to develop social, intellectual,
      physical, and emotional skills in a stimulating and fun environment. Here at
      abcs we value and respect all the children in our care.</p>\r\n<p>The six main
      areas of development are:</p>\r\n<h2>Personal, Social and Emotional Development</h2>\r\n<p>Children
      must be provided with experiences and support which will help them to develop
      a positive sense of themselves and of others; respect for others; social skills;
      and a positive disposition to learn. Providers must ensure support for children's
      emotional well-being to help them to know themselves and what they can do. We
      work closely with the parent&rsquo;s/carers in your child&rsquo;s progress;
      this can be from a baby starting to crawl, a toddler potty training, a little
      boy/girl learning to form friendships or&hellip;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Singing</li>\r\n<li>Story
      reading</li>\r\n<li>One to one time</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Communication, Language
      and Literacy</h2>\r\n<p>Children's learning and competence in communicating,
      speaking and listening, being read to and beginning to read and write must be
      supported and extended. They must be provided with opportunity and encouragement
      to use their skills in a range of situations and for a range of purposes, and
      be supported in developing the confidence and disposition to do so. We include...</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Circle
      time</li>\r\n<li>Weather board</li>\r\n<li>Reading stories</li>\r\n<li>Singing</li>\r\n<li>Key
      person/group time</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Problem Solving, Reasoning and Numeracy</h2>\r\n<p>Children
      must be supported in developing their understanding of Problem Solving, Reasoning
      and Numeracy in a broad range of contexts in which they can explore, enjoy,
      learn, practice and talk about their experiences. They must be provided with
      opportunities to practice and extend their skills in these areas and to gain
      confidence and competence in their use. To achieve this we incorporate the following...</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Puzzles</li>\r\n<li>Sorting
      trays</li>\r\n<li>Cooking</li>\r\n<li>Construction</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Knowledge
      and Understanding of the World</h2>\r\n<p>Children must be supported in developing
      the knowledge, skills and understanding that help them to make sense of the
      world. Their learning must be supported through offering opportunities for them
      to use a range of tools safely; encounter creatures, people, plants and objects
      in their natural environments and in real-life situations; undertake practical
      &lsquo;experiments&rsquo;; and work with a range of materials. We use&hellip;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Train
      tracks</li>\r\n<li>Cars</li>\r\n<li>Home corner</li>\r\n<li>Dressing up</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Physical
      Development</h2>\r\n<p>The physical development of babies and young children
      must be encouraged through the provision of opportunities for them to be active
      and interactive and to improve their skills of coordination, control, manipulation
      and movement. They must be supported in using all of their senses to learn about
      the world around them and to make connections between new information and what
      they already know. They must be supported in developing an understanding of
      the importance of physical activity and making healthy choices in relation to
      food, for example, through the use of&hellip;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Outside play</li>\r\n<li>Bike
      riding</li>\r\n<li>Slides</li>\r\n<li>Drawings</li>\r\n<li>Cutting</li>\r\n<li>Ball
      pool</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Creative Development</h2>\r\n<p>Children's creativity
      must be extended by the provision of support for their curiosity, exploration
      and play. They must be provided with opportunities to explore and share their
      thoughts, ideas and feelings, for example, through a variety of art, music,
      movement, dance, imaginative and role-play activities, mathematics, and design
      and technology. We achieve this through the use of...</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Collages</li>\r\n<li>Painting</li>\r\n<li>Dance
      and movement</li>\r\n<li>Malleable play</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Other
      Points to Note</strong></p>\r\n<p>We offer fruit and water whilst your child
      is with us. If you require your child to have anything further please bring
      this with you and hand over to the staff on arrival. Please do not forget to
      label all bottles etc. We can facilitate the heating of your child&rsquo;s food
      if required. Please label all children's clothing and bags, as we accept no
      responsibility for loss or damage to items. Please also bring with you any nappies,
      wipes, special teddies or cloths and a spare feed that your child may require
      during their stay and many spare changes of clothes, especially for potty training
      children.</p>\r\n<p>The emphasis is on FUN at all times and you can feel safe
      in the knowledge that your child is in the capable and expert hands of our dedicated,
      qualified and experienced childcare staff.</p>\r\n<p>On leaving and collecting
      your child for any session within the childcare department you must sign the
      in/out book to show you have handed your child into our care.</p>\r\n<p>We value
      any feedback and comments from parents. (Comments and suggestions box located
      within ABC&rsquo;s Corridor).</p>\r\n<h1>NEWS</h1>\r\n<h2>NEW REVISED EARLY
      YEARS FOUNDATION STAGE (EYFS) COMMENCED SEP 2012</h2>\r\n<p>What is EYFS?</p>\r\n<p>EYFS
      is the curriculum all childcare settings, which provide a service from babies
      (birth) to 5 years old children, have to adhere to.</p>\r\n<p>What does this
      mean for abc&rsquo;s and the parents / carers?</p>\r\n<p>The revised EFFS is
      not going to affect our parents too much. The biggest impact will be on myself,
      Nishma and Livon having more emphasis on working in partnership with you. This
      is so we can offer all the children attending abcs the support that they individually
      need/require.</p>\r\n<p>What is different?</p>\r\n<p>&bull; There will be a
      2 year old progress check that we carry out alongside you and multi agencies
      (e.g. health visitors) &ndash; this is to support your child&rsquo;s progress
      and development.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; The foundation years is now from pregnancy
      &ndash; 5 years.</p>\r\n<p>Are there changes in the areas of learning/development?</p>\r\n<p>&bull;
      The areas of learning have been split into 3 PRIME AREAS and 4 SPECIFIC AREAS.</p>\r\n<h2>PRIME
      AREAS</h2>\r\n<p>1-Communication and Language</p>\r\n<p>2-Physical development</p>\r\n<p>3-Personal,
      social and emotional development</p>\r\n<h2>SPECIFIC AREAS</h2>\r\n<p>1-Literacy</p>\r\n<p>2-Mathematics</p>\r\n<p>3-Understanding
      the world</p>\r\n<p>4-Expressive arts and design</p>\r\n<p>Your child&rsquo;s
      key worker will now be working alongside the 3 Prime area and 4 specific areas
      of development from the previous 6 areas of development.</p>\r\n<p>Your child&rsquo;s
      key worker will also be having more chats/meetings with you regarding your child&rsquo;s
      development, alongside using the home achievement books and where applicable,
      multi-agency to support your child&rsquo;s learning and development.</p>\r\n<h2>Helpful

      a second year running some of the children who attend abcs have recently taken
      part in a fundraising event called &lsquo;The Big Toddle&rsquo; (theme super
      heroes) for the children's charity Barnardos. We walked to St. Peter&rsquo;s
      Square, enjoyed a yummy picnic and played fun parachute games.</p>\r\n<p>The
      children gained sponsorship to take part in the toddle. We raised &pound;263
      for the charity and this will help provide 5 support courses for parents of
      children with behavioural problems. abcs are very passionate in helping the
      this charity to provide families with the support they need. All donations are
      welcome, please come and speak to Claire or any member of the cr&egrave;che
      team if you would like to make a donation.</p>\r\n<h2>Trips planned.</h2>\r\n<p>From
      September we will be looking at &lsquo;space&rsquo;. With such a fun theme,
      we hope to make an exciting journey to The Science Museum and discover all about
      planets, time and space to enhance the children&rsquo;s learning.</p>\r\n<p>We
      are also looking to visit our local library for stories and song times. This
      will be on an occasional Friday at 11.00am and we will give prior announcement
      and consent forms would need to be signed.</p>\r\n<p>Later on in the year, we
      will be looking at the season of autumn and all the changes that it brings e.g.
      changes in the leaves, what we wear, acorns and starting a nature table where
      we will try to venture out to a local park to collect leaves and conkers.</p>\r\n<h2>Farewells.</h2>\r\n<p>We
      have some children in the cr&egrave;che that have been with us for quite a long
      time that will be leaving in September, i.e. Joseph, Leo, Noah, Verity and Jessica.
      We are very sad they are leaving and we will miss them and their parents very
      much. We would like to wish them all the best in their new nurseries and we
      thank all the parents for their support.</p>\r\n<h2>New staff members.</h2>\r\n<p>You
      may have seen the introductions and photos of our two newest additions to the
      creche team in the Club newsletter.</p>\r\n<p>Shanta is our new weekend supervisor
      and Ashleigh is a nursery nurse. With a bigger team we are pleased to announce
      that from November our new weekend opening hours for Saturday and Sunday will
      be 09.00am-1.00pm and 2.00pm-5.00pm.</p>\r\n<p>Bookings can be made via reception.</p>\r\n<h2>What
      members have to say about abcs</h2>\r\n<h2>Vicky, mother to children aged 5
      and 4 years.</h2>\r\n<p>The cr&egrave;che is such a happy place that my children
      look forward to their visits.</p>\r\n<p>I have used the child care facilities
      for over 3 years for both of my children, both on a &lsquo;cr&egrave;che&rsquo;
      and &lsquo;day-care&rsquo; basis. The Foundation Sage of the curriculum is delivered
      through engaging topics. My son has practically enjoyed developing butterflies
      from caterpillars, growing vegetables in the cr&egrave;che garden and going
      on a bus and train trip, as part of the transport topic, not to mention jelly
      making and cake baking.</p>\r\n<p>As a mother it is paramount that I know my
      children are cared for thoroughly in my absence. Abc&rsquo;s has provided a
      lifeline to me, created friendships for my children and myself and is a positive
      part of their development. I cannot express strongly enough how professional
      and welcoming abc&rsquo;s staff are and I feel privileged that we are part of
      The Hogarth Cr&egrave;che group.</p>\r\n<h2>Sarah, mother of 3 year old.</h2>\r\n<p>Our
      daughter has been attending ABCs cr&egrave;che the Hogarth for almost two-and-a-half
      years. Throughout this time, ABCs&rsquo; staff have consistently delighted us
      with their passion and attention to detail when looking after her.</p>\r\n<p>Our
      daughter feels happy, relaxed and secure in the environment they create. ABCs
      staff also do their utmost to be flexible and to accommodate our childcare needs,
      often at very short notice. ABCs is a major reason for our membership of The
      Hogarth and, in our opinion, helps make it the best gym in Chiswick.</p>\r\n<h2>Anna,
      mother of 1 year old girl.</h2>\r\n<p>I have been a member of the Hogarth for
      many years and have always known there is a creche for children on the premise.
      But, until I had my daughter just over a year ago, I had no idea how wonderful
      and invaluable it is.</p>\r\n<p>ABC's is not simply a creche; it is also an
      excellent daycare with people who are outstanding at creating a nurturing, open
      and safe environment for children to learn, make friends, and develop positive
      personalities.</p>\r\n<p>The daycare provides a base foundation for learning
      but because of its smaller size there is also a personal touch that is priceless.
      I am asked every week if there is something specific that I am teaching my daughter
      so that the carers can also incorporate that into her learning plan.</p>\r\n<p>The
      balance between core activities scheduled by the creche with open play time
      has provided my daughter with an environment that she simply thrives in. When
      selecting a daycare, for me, as a parent, what I looked for was a place where
      I knew my child would be in a safe, nurturing, caring, and educational environment.
      The people at the ABC's at the Hogarth are absolutely exceptional at providing
      just that.</p>\r\n<p>If any parents/carers who have children and do not currently
      use the cr&egrave;che or day care facility are interested in what we offer you
      are welcome to come and have a chat and a look around.</p>\r\n<p>For first time
      parents we understand leaving your child for the first time, in a new unfamiliar
      environment that you or your baby doesn&rsquo;t know, can be daunting and the
      hardest thing you could possibly think of.</p>\r\n<p>We understand this and
      what we offer is support, for the parents as well as the babies/children. We
      do a minimum of 2 settling in visits for you and your baby/child to get to know
      the team and environment. During these visits we will explain our regulations
      and we will talk about your baby/child. Depending on how you feel and your child
      seems, you will have an opportunity to leave the room and see how your baby/child
      is with us. We will advise you on what works well and where positive encouragement
      and support is needed we will provide that.</p>\r\n<p>We are here to provide
      a safe, stimulating environment for the children but also for the families to
      feel a sense of trust as if we are an extended family.</p>\r\n<div class=\"call_to_action\">\r\n<h3>Call
