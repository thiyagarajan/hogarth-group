    body: "<h2>Train or Relax</h2>\r\n<p>The swimming pool is 18 metres in length
      with a level depth providing the perfect balance for training, aqua aerobics
      and relaxation.</p>\r\n<p>At night, the swimming pool is mood lit to create
      a tranquil, relaxing environment that allows you to wile away the stresses of
      the day.</p>\r\n<h2>Spa Pool</h2>\r\n<p>Aside from the physiological benefits
      of hydrotherapy on the body's musculature, the 6 person spa is the perfect place
      to mentally unwind. Heated at a perfect 48 degrees centigrade, the Hogarth spa
      is the ideal way to end your day.</p>\r\n<h2>Sauna</h2>\r\n<p>The principal
      benefit of the sauna is relaxation. The deep warmth and feeling of lassitude
      combined with one or more showers and rest periods should give the user a pleasant,
      mellow feeling. The heat also creates ideal conditions for skin toning and cleansing.</p>\r\n<p>The
      effect of the hot-cool-hot sensation allows the skin pores to open and close
      to extreme, flushing out impurities and leaving the skin thoroughly refreshed.</p>\r\n<h2>Steam
      Room</h2>\r\n<p>As soon as you step into the steam room, warmth opens the pores
      of the skin creating a flow of perspiration that lifts out the grime of everyday
      life. Your skin is cleansed and toned leaving it feeling soft, supple and healthy
      as you emerge rested and rejuvenated, ready to take on the world and all it
      can throw at you.</p>\r\n<div class=\"call_to_action\">\r\n<h3>Call us today

    body: "<p>Squash has been a part of The Hogarth Group since the late 1960's. The
      Hogarth's squash court is used extensively by members and some staff (we have
      a couple of ex National and County ranked players in our midst!)</p>\r\n<p>Squash
      is an intense game. It is both physically and mentally challenging. Most of
      all though, it's great fun. Courts at the Hogarth can be booked 7 days in advance
      and there is no charge. Every week from 6pm until 10pm on a Friday there is
      Squash Club Night. The courts are all booked out so that players can turn up
      and join in a social game of squash with the intention of meeting players of
      similar standards, followed up by the consumption of beer in the Bar afterwards
      perhaps?</p>\r\n<p>Each year we run the Hogarth Squash Tournament held over
      1 evening on a knockout basis. Members compete for the Hogarth Cup. For those
      members who wish to compete all year long, we have a Squash ladder. This allows
      members to challenge each other, thereby vying for the top position on the ladder.</p>\r\n<p>The
      squash season begins in September. If you would like to participate in the next
      tournament please speak to reception.</p>\r\n<h2><a href=\"http://hogarth-group.herokuapp.com/content/terms-and-conditions-for-booking-tennis-and-squash-courts\">Terms
