        <h4>Josephine Mitchell & <a href="#">Associates</a></h4>
 					<p>
 						Josie Mitchell BSc (Hons) is a Sports Therapist and a full member of the <a href="http://www.society-of-sports-therapists.org./">www.society-of-sports-therapists.org.</a>
 					</p>
          <p>
            She has twelve years experience as a therapist, seven of which were in a busy physiotherapy and rehabilitation practice with a further two years developing the clinic at the M8 Group, and in the training and management of their rehab team. Working with multi-disciplinary teams has led Josie to develop a holistic approach to assessment, so that individuals understand why their body is hurting as well as helping the, to move more freely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Josie and her team achieve amazing results with both elite athletes and people from all walks of life. Their focus is not simply to treat the symptoms, but to identify the cause of the problem in a realistic way, which is specific to each individual. Where appropriate they will offer referral for specialist/alternative advice and intervention.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their aim is to EDUCATE, MOTIVATE and REHABILITATE every individual to optimum levels of function through the use of proper assessment, deep tissue massage, myofascial release, manual therapy, rehabilitation exercises, stretching techniques and gait analysis. They may use dry needling techniques in her treatment and also real time ultrasound in determining whether the deep muscles in the trunk are working.
          </p>
          <p>
            A comprehensive history will be taken from you, and depending on the nature of your problem, there will usually be a head to toe assessment. Sometimes it is necessary to perform a gait analysis. A diagnosis is then given along with a treatment plan so that you are aware of how well you are progressing.
