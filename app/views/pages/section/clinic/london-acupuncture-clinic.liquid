        <h4>What is Acupuncture?</h4>
 					<p>
 						Acupuncture is the time tested therapy that has been practiced in the Far East for thousands of years. The philosophy behind the treatment is that energy lines or meridians circulate around the body. These meridians contain our energy flow or “qi”. It is when this qi is impaired through the body that imbalance and illness occurs. With the insertion of fine needles at various points on the meridian, the energy can be moved or redirected to where it is needed most. In this way the body's balance can be restored and the illness resolved.
 					</p>
          <p>
            The flow of energy can be disrupted in many ways; emotional upset, physical trauma, poor diet or overwork are all common examples. By examining this underlying cause and how it has affected the body, the most appropriate treatment for the patient can be selected. Treating the patient as an individual is at the core of the acupuncture treatment and it this that helps allow the body to rebalance itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blocked energy can manifest itself in areas that are painful or are particularly cold or hot, or a different colour. These signs can help determine which points are most suitable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Western medicine has different opinions on how acupuncture works but in short, no one is really sure. However trial after trial consistently proves it effectiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Acupuncture also includes other techniques such as cupping, moxibustion or acupressure.
