 					<p>
 						We are delighted to welcome two new professionals to The Hogarth Clinic. Carlo Constandinou and Katie Hunter run The Chiswick Osteopathic Clinic and have been working as osteopaths for many years.
 					</p>
				<h4>Carlo Constandinou</h4>
					<p>
						"I have been practicing for over twenty years; during that time I have developed a very family orientated practice.
					</p>
					<p>
						The type of osteopathy I practice is very gentle and suitable for all ages, from newborn babies upwards. I enjoy the challenge of working with complex problems and have a keen interest in biomechanics and the physiology of pain. I very much see my role as treating the present problem but also making sure it does not return. I hope that when leaving a visit at our practice the client will know a lot more about how to stay pain free than when they arrived.
            
					</p>
					<p>
						I spent years at the Osteopathic Centre for Children as one of the senior osteopaths where I was in charge of a team treating babies and children with a variety of conditions.
					</p>
					<p>
						I had the good fortune to meet and work with fantastic paediatric osteopaths. I regularly attended the paediatric intensive care unit at Barnet General where I treated severely premature babies through a glove box. I also attended Great Ormond Street Children’s hospital when any of our patients were admitted there.
					</p>
          <p>
            I look forward to meeting and working with some of you from our clinic upstairs here at The Hogarth.”
          </p>					
				<h4>Katie Hunter
        </h4>

						“I have been in practice for over ten years and my approach, like Carlo's, is very gentle and integrated. I have a strong background in science with a first class degree in microbiology. I was particularly struck by the comment of the founder of osteopathy who said that without good circulation good health is not possible. With this in mind I have developed particular skill in lymphatic drainage which, coupled with my other osteopathic skills, I find is a very effective holistic approach to health. The work has helped patients with conditions such as post operative swelling and discomfort, MS and bloating.
            
					</p>
					<p>
						I use a lot of soft tissue techniques in my work and this allows me to treat people who feel that they are in need of general maintenance and would benefit from a massage but would like it to be more specific and targeted to any problems that are discovered.”
