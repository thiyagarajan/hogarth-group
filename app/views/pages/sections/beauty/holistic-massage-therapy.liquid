        <h1>Holistic Massage Therapy</h1>
          <p>
            Massage has long been understood to be an effective treatment for both stress and muscular stiffness and pain. Massage involves the use of both deep tissue manipulation and a combination of gentler therapies to relax and help release muscular tension, stress, bad posture and headaches. Massage can also help heal injuries such as tendonitis that develop over time, as well as ligament sprains or muscle strains caused by an accident. Massage reduces inflammation by increasing circulation, which removes waste products and brings nutrition to injured cells.
