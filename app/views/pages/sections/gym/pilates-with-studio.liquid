            The Pilates Method was originally developed by Joseph Pilates in the 1920's. Joseph Pilates practiced and taught his method (originally called Contrology) throughout his life up to his death at the age of 86.{% endeditable_text %}

          <p>{% editable_text title223, hint: "a title", format: raw, rows: 1 %}
            Pilates is a conditioning exercise programme that targets the deep postural muscles of the abdomen and spine to improve overall central core stability and posture. The following eight Pilates principles are: Concentration, centering, breathing, isolation, routine, precision, control and flowing movement.{% endeditable_text %}
          </p>
          <p>{% editable_text title224, hint: "a title", format: raw, rows: 1 %}
            Clinical Pilates is a series of exercises in various different body positions which have been adapted by physiotherapists to make them more suitable for patients with back and neck pain, and those recovering from injury. They are also useful for general conditioning and for prevention of injury through muscle wastage and poor posture.{% endeditable_text %}
          </p>
          <p>{% editable_text title225, hint: "a title", format: raw, rows: 1 %}
            By completing Pilates exercises regularly, it can help to improve your posture, strength and flexibility alongside a healthy lifestyle.
            {% endeditable_text %}

          <p>{% editable_text title226, hint: "a title", format: raw, rows: 1 %}
            Many patients find that Pilates is a useful form of exercise when returning to their normal hobbies/sports following injury and as an addition to their fitness regime. Who would have thought that many rugby teams around the world would use Pilates as a valuable addition to their game winning strategies?
            {% endeditable_text %}
          </p>
          <p>{% editable_text title227, hint: "a title", format: raw, rows: 1 %}
            Evidence supports the use of the Pilates method in the prevention and rehabilitation of back injuries. By retraining the deep abdominal and spinal muscles, Pilates can help to prevent the recurrence of back pain in combination with correct back care and advice, and gentle aerobic activity.
            {% endeditable_text %}
          </p>
          <p>{% editable_text title228, hint: "a title", format: raw, rows: 1 %}
            For these reasons we truly believe that this branch of The Pilates Method is the most valuable and is a greatest addition to any existing fitness routine or to pull anyone out of a sedentary lifestyle.
