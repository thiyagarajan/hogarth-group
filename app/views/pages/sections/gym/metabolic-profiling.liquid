				<h4>{% editable_text title232, hint: "a title", format: raw, rows: 1 %}What is Metabolic Profile Testing?{% endeditable_text %}</h4>
					<p>{% editable_text title233, hint: "a title", format: raw, rows: 1 %}
						A simple assessment allows your metabolic profile to be 'captured' and the information will produce your individual metabolic profile. The profile includes your resting metabolic rate (RMR), your daily calorific needs and the heart rate zones in which your body best responds to exercise. Testing is quick and easy and includes a test to determine your resting metabolic rate and another test to determine your metabolic responses to exercise. Throughout the test the system is capturing information about your heart rate, oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide output.{% endeditable_text %}
					</p>
				<h4>{% editable_text title234, hint: "a title", format: raw, rows: 1 %}How Does Metabolic Profiling Help?{% endeditable_text %}</h4>
					<p>{% editable_text title235, hint: "a title", format: raw, rows: 1 %}
						With your unique profile you can more easily achieve weight loss goals and improve aerobic fitness by optimising your exercise plan. Your resting test illustrates how many calories you can eat without gaining weight and how you can maximise calories burned in every workout. Your exercise test results show what heart rate zones to train in for your body to become more efficient at burning fat as an energy source, how to build a stronger & wider aerobic base and what your anaerobic threshold is and how to move this higher. Whatever your training goals are, your metabolic profile is the key to training more effectively and efficiently to optimise your training results.
