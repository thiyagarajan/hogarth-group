 						Physiotherapy is a comprehensive service specialising in dance and sports injuries together with back and neck care, and joint, muscle and ligament problems that can result from any day-to-day activities. Treatment focuses on pain relief, early recovery and the teaching of corrective exercises, helping the patient to understand the problem and promoting confidence on return to exercise.{% endeditable_text %}

						Physiotherapy assesses and treats symptoms resulting from injury, or those which develop from poor postural habits that stress joints, ligaments, muscles, soft tissue and nerves. An expert knowledge of body mechanics and function is used to identify the origin of symptoms. Many therapy skills and techniques are used: manipulative therapy; postural advice; mobilisation therapy; electrotherapy; and soft tissue techniques. Corrective exercises are used to restore the balance between weak muscles and tight structures. Prevention of further symptoms is achieved with the prescription of exercises, advice and suggested changes to training programmes and office ergonomics. Each programme is tailor-made.{% endeditable_text %}
